## Principle of operation
All the **information about weather** is getting sent from [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The page sends a **request** with some city name (multilanguage type is supported) to the API and gets the **results** back. An application shows such information as current temperature, the "feels like tempetature" and humidity.

## How to run the project
To open the project you need to have at least [React](https://reactjs.org/) installed.

Here are some steps to run the project:
1. Download the files, unpack them and open a folder in your IDE (e.g. Visual Studio).
2. Open the terminal and put there the next line:
`npm start`
3. Your browser will open the project under the address **localhost:3000**.
4. Type any city in the searchbar and press Enter. Good job! :sunglasses:
